      p2: "How we meet the built environment depends on both bodies and worlds. The world is built for the average person, but we are not ordinary people. We have normalized the idea of an ideal body, and anything deviant of that is less than normal.",
      p3: "Disability results from the shape of the world's rigidly, lacking the sense of what a body does or how it moves through the world. We see disability as moments when the body finds itself in \"misfit\" relationship to the world: a disharmony between the world and the body.",

However, many opted out since the culturally a scar, a limp, or an empty sleeve became a way to announce a legacy of heroism. In 1945, prosthetics and rehabilitation became the \"social engineering of the future.\" Prosthetics became a symbol to fix injury, identity, and culture.",

        text: "From a mechanical limb extension, anchored in a harness, with a double-hook hand at the end that opens and closes online with a shoulder shrug, prosthetics have made an impressive leap in engineering and a similar leap in expense. Myoelectrics create a more realistic and fluid motion for artificial limbs. A myoelectric model creates motion by the electrical signals naturally build into the body's muscles.",

However, these newer prosthetics are more evidence of an endlessly plastic and adaptive human body. The prosthetics is only a portion of who the person is. These objects are but an extension of the body that reflects the material culture and its relationship with the external world. Amputees are not half-human hybrids; they are people.",

Prosthetics can be seen as a way amputees re-build themselves or, through a use-centered lens, it can recast the meaning of the wonders of human adaptation. May you take the invitation to consider your own extended body with the recognition that the same assemblage is happening for all of us. How our bodies sense and move and think is intertwined with the way we meet the built world.",

Has humans, we have learned to augment everyday tasks with simple everyday tools. Any of a human's hundred daily motor-driven tasks are made up of macro and micro-movements that have become automatic. However, they can also be adjusted. The body and the person are the site of infinite adaptation and expand the definition of technology in how it encompasses how bodies meet the work or tool and spaces to live life."

The historical chair was an expression of status and rank with a structure that puts a body higher than other individuals. However, these poorly designed chairs have become \"do-it-yourself murder.\" They are not a response to our bodies' realities nor its natural evolution; chairs are shroud design – a preoccupation with the way things look on the outside, at the expense of function and sustainability.",

The bodiedness of people get lost even though we think that our bodies all work the same.

Cardboard has an experimental spirit but offers sturdy strength. When three layers are stacked together, corrugated in between in a wavelike formation, its structure becomes strong enough to hold up to 1,100 pounds per square inch. This material is a cheap and strong material that allows for creating bespoke and custom products for individual people.",

They are determined to alert everyone of how arbitrary the design of the built world is. The ADA founder, Alex Truesdall, wanted to see ways to better sculpt and customize the best chair for all bodies meeting the world. Their chairs for hundreds of children are all instances in which universalisms reveals its limitations and each an invitation to re-think mass production.",

We should believe that the right modification is out there and that the adaptive approach to design is infectious and consciousness-changing. There is no such thing as the average person, so how might design leave behind the average all together?"

There is an increase of social awareness, not just for ones but for others, that is naturalized in the behavior with the social work of sign. Sign Language pushes us to consider how we move around our environment without stopping conversating because of the physical world.

Wood reverberates when struck. Concrete and plastic absorb sound. Material can act as the extension of our senses. Sounds is multidimensional and multisensory because it is a wave.

These are spaces that maximized the sensory reach by extending the possibilities of a visual language. Rather than setting up a classroom with desks in rows facing the front of the class like a tennis match with a back-and-forth exchange, we can create a space that can easily be shifted and expanded to create shared interactions that multidimensional."

However, to be interdependent, we must acknowledge our dependency. As humans, we ebb and flow into moments where we are dependent. As a society, we see dependency as an aspect we fear and loath because of its connection with disability. But disability may as well be a fundamental aspect of being human.

But what if they were action settings – built places that arise from interactions, experience, and the physical features around us? Action settings can help us makes sense of how we behave in and use a space according to our bodies and abilities. Instead of describing our world in binary terms, we should reconsider our ideas of independence and find new ways of what it means to dwell."

People with disabilities saw the design of the streets as a part of their political rights—streets were initially built for working men with physically strong bodies with little to no caretaking responsibilities. However, in the 1960s, disability activists took to the streets by either mix concrete to create a smooth passage from the side to the street or smashed the concrete curb away to create a guerrilla-style cut. These acts were not just political statements, but people \"editing\" the city; they were not waiting for new architecture to be built, so they created a world that fit them by making and unmaking the inherent build world.",

        text: "We navigate the built environment in hundreds of ways. We adjust our bodies to the space we inhabit and navigate based on what is there. Desire lines are indications of yearning, a path created by repetition and time. These desire lines are ways our bodies fight the misfits of the world until the built world catches up. They are a human choice, not only organized by efficiency but by desire. They are ways we can temporarily edit the shapes, sounds, and sight of the world that is the right mix for our bodies' individual affordances.",

We are designing our world to last, but if that world can't accommodate all humans, we need to consider a more porous environment. Big changes take small steps, public spectacles, testing, and patience. While our environment is not malleable, we as people are continuously making and remaking its passages and textures. \"Design includes unmaking and remaking with a combination of small gestures and big ideas,\" and the world needs to be designed with some porousness and flexibility around its edges."

The time to cross the street was created with this kind of \"universal\" time in mind. Nevertheless, different types of people may need a different amount of time to cross. In New York, some crosswalks have increased their time permanently. In Singapore, they created a system that loosens the city's structure. Those needing extra time can tap their Green Man + (Plus) card against an electronic sensor, and additional time is added. Our bodies are all different, and urban design is slowly moving towards something that allows time to expand and contract on command.",

Disabilities and illness have the power to extract itself from the linear idea of time. Crip Time is a name \"that disabled people have repurpose in the act of political reincarnation, dropping degradation attached to a word that was used to describe the past, cripple, and investing it with in-group pride.\" Crip time can also be seen as \"time travel,\" as it describes the out-of-sync plotting of life. This idea of time pushed us to think about why our bodies are tied to this concept of time.",

We need to co-create a way of life, of world-building.
